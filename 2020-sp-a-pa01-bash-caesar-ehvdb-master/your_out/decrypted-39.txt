A long line: 
If there is no struggle there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may be both moral and physical,but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. -- Frederick Douglass
